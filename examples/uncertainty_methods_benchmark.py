# # Benchmarking Uncertainty Estimation Methods
#
# This notebook compares the computational cost of different uncertainty estimation methods
# available in the `calcurve` package:
#
# - Clopper-Pearson interval (exact method)
# - Wilson Score with continuity correction (approximate method)
# - Bootstrap (resampling method)
#
# We'll analyze how the computation time scales with:
# 1. Dataset size
# 2. Number of bins
# 3. Number of bootstrap iterations (for bootstrap method only)

# ## Analysis of Results
#
# ### Dataset Size Impact
# - There is a clear separation between analytical methods (Wilson-CC, Clopper-Pearson) and bootstrap:
#   - Bootstrap is 10-100x slower and shows clear linear scaling with dataset size
#   - Analytical methods are much faster (<0.002s) even for 100K samples
# - For analytical methods:
#   - Wilson-CC is slightly faster than Clopper-Pearson for small datasets
#   - The difference becomes negligible for larger datasets (>50K samples)
#   - Both show very small standard deviations, indicating stable performance
# - The bootstrap method:
#   - Shows clear linear scaling in log-space
#   - Has larger standard deviations, especially for bigger datasets
#   - Takes ~0.2s for 100K samples vs ~0.01s for 1K samples
#
# ### Number of Bins Impact
# - The impact of bin count is very different between methods:
#   - Bootstrap: Major impact, from 0.025s (5 bins) to 0.040s (100 bins)
#   - Analytical: Minor impact, from 0.0005s to 0.005s across all bin counts
# - Key observations:
#   - Analytical methods scale linearly but with very small slope
#   - Bootstrap shows sublinear scaling with number of bins
#   - Standard deviations are proportional to mean times for all methods
#   - Wilson-CC maintains small but consistent advantage over Clopper-Pearson
#
# ### Bootstrap Iterations Impact
# - Perfect linear relationship between iterations and computation time
# - Quantitative scaling:
#   - ~0.00026s per iteration (derived from slope)
#   - 100 iterations: ~0.026s
#   - 1000 iterations: ~0.26s
# - Very small standard deviations (not visible in plot), indicating consistent performance
#
# ### Recommendations
# 1. Default Choice:
#    - Use Wilson-CC as the default method
#    - It's fast, has small variance, and provides good statistical properties
#
# 2. Large Datasets (>50K samples):
#    - Both analytical methods perform similarly
#    - Avoid bootstrap unless specifically needed for statistical reasons
#    - If using bootstrap, consider reducing number of bins to compensate
#
# 3. Bootstrap Configuration:
#    - 100 iterations provides good balance (0.026s computation time)
#    - Only increase iterations if confidence interval precision is critical
#    - Consider reducing bins to 20-50 range to improve performance
#
# 4. Number of Bins:
#    - With analytical methods: Feel free to use 50-100 bins
#    - With bootstrap: Stay in 20-50 range unless more resolution is critical
#    - Bin count has minimal impact on analytical methods' performance
#
# ### Implementation Notes
# The performance characteristics align with the algorithmic complexity:
# - Analytical methods: O(n) for binning + O(bins) for intervals
# - Bootstrap: O(n * iterations) for resampling + O(bins * iterations) for intervals
# - The constant factors in analytical methods are very small, making them practical
#   even for large datasets with many bins
